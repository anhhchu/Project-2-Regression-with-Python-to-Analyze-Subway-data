    This function should run a SQL query on a dataframe of
    weather data.  The SQL query should return one column and
    one row - a count of the number of days in the dataframe where
    the rain column is equal to 1 (i.e., the number of days it
    rained).  The dataframe will be titled 'weather_data'. You'll
    need to provide the SQL query.  You might find SQL's count function
    useful for this exercise.  You can read more about it here:
    
    https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.1/en/counting-rows.html
    
    You might also find that interpreting numbers as integers or floats may not
    work initially.  In order to get around this issue, it may be useful to cast
    these numbers as integers.  This can be done by writing cast(column as integer).
    So for example, if we wanted to cast the maxtempi column as an integer, we would actually
    write something like where cast(maxtempi as integer) = 76, as opposed to simply 
    where maxtempi = 76.

    Filenames is a list of MTA Subway turnstile text files. A link to an example
    MTA Subway turnstile text file can be seen at the URL below:

    As you can see, there are numerous data points included in each row of the
    a MTA Subway turnstile text file. 

    You want to write a function that will update each row in the text
    file so there is only one entry per row. A few examples below:
    A002,R051,02-00-00,05-28-11,00:00:00,REGULAR,003178521,001100739

    Write the updates to a different text file in the format of "updated_" + filename.
    For example:
        1) if you read in a text file called "turnstile_110521.txt"
        2) you should write the updated data to "updated_turnstile_110521.txt"

    The order of the fields should be preserved. Remember to read through the 
    Instructor Notes below for more details on the task.
